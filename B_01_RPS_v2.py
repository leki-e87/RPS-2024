**** Instructions ****

To begin, choose the number of rounds (or press <enter> for
infinite mode).

Then play against the computer. You need to choose R (rock), P (paper) or S (scissors).

The rules are as follows:
 -> Rock beats Scissors
 -> Scissors beats Paper
 -> Paper beats Rock.

Type [xxx] to end the game at anytime you'd like.

Good Luck!
